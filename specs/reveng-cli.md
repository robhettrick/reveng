# reveng CLI — Specification

## Overview

`reveng` is a standalone bash CLI that wraps the `reveng` Claude Code plugin, providing a command-driven developer experience for reverse-engineering legacy applications.

It is a companion to [ralph](https://github.com/DEFRA/ralph) (the autonomous AI coding agent loop runner used in the re-engineering phase). Ralph handles re-engineering (`ralph plan`, `ralph build`); reveng handles reverse engineering (`reveng curate`, `reveng synth`, `reveng decompose`). Both tools provide their own `sandbox` command for running inside a devcontainer. The two tools share conventions but are independently installable.

## Design Principles

- **Headless by default** — commands run non-interactively end-to-end and produce output files
- **Sensible defaults, escape hatches for power users** — works out of the box for newcomers, with flags for model selection, verbosity, and backend control
- **Mirror ralph's conventions** — single bash script, `cmd_<name>` functions, similar flag style, same installation layout pattern
- **Warn outside containers** — prints a safety warning when `--dangerously-skip-permissions` is used outside a devcontainer (like ralph does)

## Target Audience

Mixed teams: some developers familiar with Claude Code internals, others encountering it for the first time. The CLI abstracts away workspace setup, model flags, and permission flags behind simple commands, but exposes them as options for those who need control.

## Repository

Lives in the `reveng` repo. The repo gains:

## Installation

### Layout

`install.sh` copies files to:

| Source | Destination |
|--------|------------|
| `reveng` | `~/.local/bin/reveng` |
| `skills/`, `agents/`, `hooks/` | `~/.config/reveng/plugin/` |
| `templates/workspace-CLAUDE.md` | `~/.config/reveng/plugin/CLAUDE.md` |
| `container/Dockerfile`, `container/devcontainer.json` | `~/.config/reveng/container/` |

The contents of `~/.config/reveng/plugin/` are the source from which `reveng init` copies into a workspace.

Override with `REVENG_BIN_DIR` and `REVENG_CONFIG_DIR` environment variables.

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) CLI installed and authenticated
- Bash 4+
- `jq` (for parsing Claude output in headless mode)
- For `reveng sandbox` only: Docker and the [`devcontainer` CLI](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli) (`npm install -g @devcontainers/cli`)

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marc0der/reveng
cd reveng
./install.sh
```

### Uninstall

```bash
rm ~/.local/bin/reveng
rm -rf ~/.config/reveng
```

## Commands

### `reveng curate`

Prepares raw screenshots and interview transcripts into structured, analysis-ready outputs.

**What it runs**: The `digital-content-curator` agent via Claude Code, which in turn invokes the `image-to-html` and `curate-transcript` skills.

**Inputs** (from current working directory):
- `screenshots/*.{png,jpg,jpeg,gif,bmp,webp}`
- `transcripts/*.txt`

**Outputs**:
- `output/html/*.html` — semantic HTML mockups of each screenshot
- `output/transcripts/*_curated.*` — transcripts with off-topic content removed, keeping the source extension

**Options**:
| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `-m, --model MODEL` | `opus` | Claude model to use |
| `-e, --effort LEVEL` | `high`, or `xhigh` with `--confluence` | Reasoning effort: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` |
| `--confluence` | off | Curate a Confluence/wiki export under `confluence-export/` (or `$REVENG_EXPORT_DIR`) with the `confluence-curator` agent, instead of screenshots and transcripts |
| `-v, --verbose` | off | Show Claude commands and raw output |
| `--dry-run` | off | Print what would be executed without running |

**Example**:
```bash
reveng curate
reveng curate -m sonnet
reveng curate --dry-run
```

### `reveng synth`

Runs the four analysis agents (where their outputs are missing) and synthesises the results into a Product Requirements Document.

**What it runs**: The `product-manager` agent. Internally, product-manager launches any missing analyst agents (`business-analyst`, `interaction-analyst`, `application-developer`, `database-analyst`) via Task before producing the PRD. Existing analysis files are reused; analysts only run for missing outputs.

**Prerequisites**: Curated content must exist (run `reveng curate` first). The command validates this before proceeding.

**Inputs**:
- `output/html/*.html`
- `output/transcripts/*_curated.*`
- `src/` (legacy source code, optional — drives the code analysts)
- `output/domain-analysis.md`, `output/interaction-analysis.md`, `output/application-analysis.md`, `output/database-analysis.md` (reused if present, generated otherwise)

**Outputs**:
- `output/domain-analysis.md`
- `output/interaction-analysis.md`
- `output/application-analysis.md`
- `output/database-analysis.md`
- `output/PRD.md`

**Options**:
| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `-m, --model MODEL` | `opus` | Claude model to use |
| `-e, --effort LEVEL` | — | Reasoning effort for both phases: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` |
| `--analysis-effort LEVEL` | `xhigh` | Effort for the four analysts |
| `--prd-effort LEVEL` | `max` | Effort for the PRD synthesis |
| `-v, --verbose` | off | Show Claude commands and raw output |
| `--dry-run` | off | Print what would be executed without running |

**Example**:
```bash
reveng synth
reveng synth -m sonnet --verbose
```

### `reveng decompose`

Decomposes the PRD into individually deliverable feature specifications.

**What it runs**: The `prd-to-features` agent, which spawns parallel `feature-writer` sub-agents.

**Prerequisites**: `output/PRD.md` must exist. The command validates this before proceeding.

**Inputs**:
- `output/PRD.md`

**Outputs**:
- `output/features/FT-XXX-*.md` — individual feature specifications

**Options**:
| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `-m, --model MODEL` | `opus` | Claude model to use |
| `-e, --effort LEVEL` | varies by command | Reasoning effort: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` |
| `-v, --verbose` | off | Show Claude commands and raw output |
| `--dry-run` | off | Print what would be executed without running |

**Example**:
```bash
reveng decompose
```

### `reveng sandbox`

Starts (or reuses) a devcontainer for the current working directory and drops the user into a `zsh` shell inside it. The container provides a clean, network-isolated environment where Claude Code can run with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` safely.

**What it runs**: `devcontainer up` followed by `devcontainer exec ... zsh`, using the devcontainer config installed at `~/.config/reveng/container/devcontainer.json`.

**Subcommands**:
- `reveng sandbox` — start or attach to the project's container
- `reveng sandbox --rebuild` — rebuild the container image from scratch (`--remove-existing-container --build-no-cache`)
- `reveng sandbox clean` — remove the project's container (looks up by `devcontainer.local_folder=$PWD` label and runs `docker rm -f`)

**Container contents** (defined in `container/Dockerfile`):
- Node 20 base image
- Claude Code (`@anthropic-ai/claude-code`) preinstalled globally
- Standard dev tools: `git`, `gh`, `jq`, `zsh`, `ripgrep`, `fzf`, `bat`, `neovim`, `curl`
- Non-root `node` user with passwordless sudo
- `DEVCONTAINER=true` env set so the safety warning is suppressed inside

**Mounts** (set up at `devcontainer up` time):
| Mount | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `$PWD` → `/workspace` | The project (workspace folder) |
| `$(command -v reveng)` → `/usr/local/bin/reveng` | The CLI itself, so `reveng curate`/`synth`/`decompose` work inside |
| `~/.config/reveng` → `/home/node/.config/reveng` | Plugin content, container config |
| `~/.claude` → `/home/node/.claude` | Claude Code credentials and settings |
| `~/.ssh` (if exists) → `/home/node/.ssh` | Git SSH access |
| `~/.config/gh` (if exists) → `/home/node/.config/gh` | GitHub CLI auth |
| `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK` (if set) → `/tmp/ssh-agent.sock` | SSH agent forwarding |
| `ralph-history-<workspace-hash>` volume → `/commandhistory` | Persistent shell history per workspace |

**Env passthrough** (forwarded with `--remote-env` if set on the host):
- `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` (rewritten to the mounted socket path)
- `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

Both `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` unset and `SSH_AUTH_SOCK=""` must be treated the same: no mount, no `--remote-env`. Use `[[ -n "${SSH_AUTH_SOCK:-}" ]]` for the guard. When expanding the resulting `--remote-env` array into the `devcontainer up`/`exec` command, use the `${ssh_env[@]+"${ssh_env[@]}"}` pattern rather than `"${ssh_env[@]}"` — this is required for bash 3.2 (macOS system bash) under `set -u`, where expanding an empty array as `"${arr[@]}"` raises "unbound variable". This mirrors the fix applied in ralph.

**Prerequisites**:
- `devcontainer` CLI on `PATH`
- `docker` running
- Current directory is inside a git repository
- `~/.config/reveng/container/devcontainer.json` exists (installed by `install.sh`)

**Options**:
| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--rebuild` | off | Rebuild the container image from scratch |

**Example**:
```bash
cd my-legacy-app
reveng sandbox
# inside the container:
node@sandbox:/workspace$ reveng curate
node@sandbox:/workspace$ exit

reveng sandbox --rebuild   # force fresh build
reveng sandbox clean       # remove the project's container
```

### `reveng init`

Scaffolds the expected directory structure in the current working directory, copies reveng's agents and skills into `.claude/`, copies the workspace `CLAUDE.md`, and updates `.gitignore`. Existing files at the destination are skipped (with a warning), so local edits are preserved across re-runs.

**Creates**:
```
screenshots/
transcripts/
src/
output/
.claude/agents/<name>/AGENT.md   (copied from ~/.config/reveng/plugin/agents/)
.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md   (copied from ~/.config/reveng/plugin/skills/)
CLAUDE.md                        (copied from ~/.config/reveng/plugin/CLAUDE.md)
```

**Adds to `.gitignore`**:
```
.claude/
output/html/
output/transcripts/*_curated.*
```

**Refresh policy**: re-running `reveng init` skips any file that already exists at the destination. To refresh a specific agent or skill, delete it from `.claude/` first and re-run init. The workspace `CLAUDE.md` is treated the same way.

**Prerequisite**: the install must have been run (so `~/.config/reveng/plugin/` exists). If it has not, init exits with an error pointing the user at `install.sh`.

**Options**:
| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| (none) | | |

**Example**:
```bash
mkdir my-legacy-app && cd my-legacy-app
git init
reveng init
```

### `reveng version`

Prints the version and exits.

```bash
$ reveng version
reveng 0.2.0
```

### `reveng help`

Prints usage information.

## Global Options

These flags are accepted by all commands that invoke Claude:

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `-m, --model MODEL` | varies by command | Claude model to use |
| `-e, --effort LEVEL` | varies by command | Reasoning effort: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` |
| `-v, --verbose` | off | Show Claude commands and raw output |
| `--dry-run` | off | Print what would be executed without running |
| `-h, --help` | | Show help |

## Invocation Mechanism

Each command shells out to Claude Code in headless mode, passing a natural-language prompt that asks Claude to run the relevant agent. We do **not** use slash-command invocation (`/agent-name`) — the agent is named in plain English so the CLI's behaviour stays identical to interactive use. Users get the same result whether they run `reveng curate` or paste the prompt into a `claude` session by hand.

```bash
claude -p "$prompt" \
  --dangerously-skip-permissions \
  --output-format stream-json \
  --model "$model"
```

Claude Code discovers agents and skills from the workspace's `.claude/` directory, which `reveng init` populates from `~/.config/reveng/plugin/`. Before invoking Claude, each command verifies that `.claude/agents/` exists and exits with a friendly error pointing to `reveng init` if not.

### Prompts per command

Each `cmd_*` function passes a fixed, one-line prompt. These are taken verbatim from the playbook examples where available:

| Command | Prompt |
|---------|--------|
| `curate` | `` Please could you run the `digital-content-curator` agent to prepare all the screenshots and transcripts for analysis? Thank you. `` |
| `synth` | `` Run the `product-manager` agent to analyse the application and produce the PRD. `` |
| `decompose` | `` Please could you run the `prd-to-features` agent to decompose the PRD into individual feature specifications? Thank you. `` |

The prompts are short and stable, so they live as string literals in the bash script rather than in template files. If a prompt grows or needs templating (e.g. `{{GOAL}}` substitution like ralph), it should be moved to `~/.config/reveng/prompts/<command>.md` and resolved via a `resolve_prompt` helper — but this is not required for the initial implementation.

### Safety Warning

When `DEVCONTAINER` is not set to `true`, the CLI prints a warning to stderr (mirroring ralph's behaviour):

```
⚠️  WARNING: Running with --dangerously-skip-permissions outside a container.
⚠️  Claude will have unrestricted access to tools (file writes, shell commands, etc).
⚠️  For safer execution, use a devcontainer or container sandbox.
```

## Script Structure

The CLI is a single bash script following ralph's conventions:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

VERSION="0.2.0"
CONFIG_DIR="${REVENG_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.config/reveng}"
PLUGIN_DIR="$CONFIG_DIR/plugin"

# Default models per command
CURATE_DEFAULT_MODEL="opus"
SYNTH_DEFAULT_MODEL="opus"
DECOMPOSE_DEFAULT_MODEL="opus"

# Effort differs by command, and synth carries two: curate is mechanical
# dispatch (flat curve, most subagent calls); the synth analysts do coverage
# work and run four times per synth; the PRD synthesis is reasoning-ceiling
# work and runs once. Set any to "" to inherit the harness default.
CURATE_DEFAULT_EFFORT="high"
SYNTH_ANALYSIS_DEFAULT_EFFORT="xhigh"
SYNTH_PRD_DEFAULT_EFFORT="max"
DECOMPOSE_DEFAULT_EFFORT="xhigh"

usage()          { ... }
cmd_version()    { ... }
cmd_init()       { ... }
cmd_curate()     { ... }
cmd_synth()      { ... }
cmd_decompose()  { ... }
cmd_sandbox()    { ... }  # devcontainer up + exec zsh; handles --rebuild and `clean` subcommand
sandbox_clean()  { ... }  # docker rm -f the container labelled with this workspace

# Shared helpers
run_claude()     { ... }  # Builds and executes the claude command
warn_permissions() { ... }  # Prints container safety warning
validate_inputs()  { ... }  # Checks prerequisite files exist

# Main dispatch
case "${1:-}" in
    curate)      shift; cmd_curate "$@" ;;
    synth)       shift; cmd_synth "$@" ;;
    decompose)   shift; cmd_decompose "$@" ;;
    sandbox)     shift; cmd_sandbox "$@" ;;
    init)        shift; cmd_init "$@" ;;
    version)     cmd_version ;;
    -h|--help)   usage ;;
    "")          usage ;;
    *)           echo "Error: unknown command '$1'" >&2; exit 1 ;;
esac
```

## Prerequisite Validation

Commands that depend on prior stages validate inputs before invoking Claude:

| Command | Validates |
|---------|-----------|
| `curate` | At least one file in `screenshots/` or `transcripts/` |
| `synth` | At least one file in `output/html/` and at least one file in `output/transcripts/*_curated.*` (the product-manager agent enforces the same prerequisite internally) |
| `decompose` | `output/PRD.md` exists |

Validation failures print a clear message pointing to the prerequisite command:

```
Error: no curated content found.
Run 'reveng curate' first to prepare screenshots and transcripts.
```

## Output Parsing

Claude's `--output-format stream-json` output is parsed with jq (same filter as ralph's claude backend):

```bash
jq -r 'select(.type == "result") | .result // empty'
```

The final result text is printed to stdout. In `--verbose` mode, the full stream-json output is also printed to stderr.

## Relationship to ralph

| Concern | ralph | reveng |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Phase | Re-engineering | Reverse engineering |
| Installed to | `~/.local/bin/ralph` | `~/.local/bin/reveng` |
| Config at | `~/.config/ralph/` | `~/.config/reveng/` |
| Backend | Pluggable (claude, codex) | Claude only |
| Loop | Iterative plan/build loops | Single-shot agent invocations |
| Sandbox | Built-in devcontainer (`ralph sandbox`) | Built-in devcontainer (`reveng sandbox`) — Claude-only image, no codex |
| Script style | Single bash script, `cmd_*` functions | Same |
| Flag conventions | `-m`, `-v`, `--dry-run`, `-h` | Same |

## Out of Scope

- **Pipeline orchestration**: No `reveng run` command that chains all stages. Users run commands individually and inspect outputs between stages.
- **Re-engineering commands**: No wrapping of ralph. The two CLIs are independent.
- **Interactive mode**: All commands run headlessly. For interactive use, `cd` into a reveng workspace (one that has been `reveng init`-ialised) and run `claude` directly — agents and skills are discovered from `.claude/`.

## Open Questions

1. **Should the CLI capture and store Claude session logs?** Useful for debugging but adds complexity. Could write to `.reveng/logs/`.
    Answer: No, but errors should be surfaced up the the user appropriately if hit.
2. **Should `install.sh` support an `--update` mode** that overwrites existing installed files without prompting, for easy upgrades?
    Answer: Yes
